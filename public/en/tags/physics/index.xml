      <description>I recently came across some experiment on youtube about something called &amp;ldquo;cold fire&amp;rdquo;. It sound contradictory, right? How can fire, something that is inherently hot, be cold? Well, that is what we are going to explore in this blog post.&#xA;What is fire? To understand fire, we need to understand plasma. It is the 4th state of matter, right after gas. When a gas gets extremely hot, the electrons inside a substance have enough energy to detach from their atom and move freely.</description>

      <description>I was bored so I went down the rabbit hole of engineering disasters. One disaster that caught my eyes was the OceanGate&amp;rsquo;s Titan incident. It caught my eyes because I was curious about how much pressure was applied onto the submarine at that depth, so I grab my calculator and got to work.&#xA;The most dangerous thing about deep ocean is probably the hydrostatic pressure. This pressure is proportional to the depth measured from the surface of the water body.</description>
