      <description>I was bored so I went down the rabbit hole of engineering disasters. One disaster that caught my eyes was the OceanGate&amp;rsquo;s Titan incident. It caught my eyes because I was curious about how much pressure was applied onto the submarine at that depth, so I grab my calculator and got to work.&#xA;The most dangerous thing about deep ocean is probably the hydrostatic pressure. This pressure is proportional to the depth measured from the surface of the water body.</description>
