      <description>We are going to build an operating system from scratch. Why you may ask? Well, I had finished an operating system class a few semester ago but it was a whole lot of theory and no practice on those theory what so ever. After that class, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I truly understand operating system and how they work. So I decided to try to make my own operating system to get more practical experience and a deeper understanding of OS development.</description>

      <title>Decrypting a Serial-To-WiFi device&#39;s firmware</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some research into reverse engineering for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been learning about firmware and embedded systems for a long time. And I thought &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool to combine these to skills to do something?&amp;rdquo;. So I decided to try decrypting the encrypted firmware of the a Serial-To-WiFi device. I&amp;rsquo;ve documented my process here in this blog post.&#xA;The device I recently read that there was a vulnerability in the Moxa NPort W2150A Serial-To-Wifi device that exploit stack-based buffer overflow.</description>

      <title>Fire! But cold</title>

      <description>I recently came across some experiment on youtube about something called &amp;ldquo;cold fire&amp;rdquo;. It sound contradictory, right? How can fire, something that is inherently hot, be cold? Well, that is what we are going to explore in this blog post.&#xA;What is fire? To understand fire, we need to understand plasma. It is the 4th state of matter, right after gas. When a gas gets extremely hot, the electrons inside a substance have enough energy to detach from their atom and move freely.</description>

      <title>ESXiArgs: An Analysis</title>

      <description>Last year, a ransomware attack called ESXiArgs managed to encrypt hundreds of VMware machines in multiple different countries. And I decided to try my hands at reverse engineering and analyzing this malware to see how it works. So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s reverse this.&#xA;Note: The malware sample was provided by the bleepingcomputer forum&#xA;The script So right out of the gate, in the script, there&amp;rsquo;s a section called CHANGE CONFIG:</description>

      <title>8-bit Computer in FPGA</title>

      <description>Computers are mysterious. These machines have always been so enigmatic to most people. I can guarantee that if you ask someone on the road how computers work, they would most likely just answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;I was like that for a long time, even after I started learning programming. So I decided that I will learn how a computer works by building one.&#xA;At first, I was thinking about building a breadboard computer like Ben Eater.</description>

      <title>The world&#39;s most harmless ransomware</title>
      <link>https://namberino.github.io/posts/2024/02/the-worlds-most-harmless-ransomware/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: Please do NOT use this for malicious intent. This is purely for educational purpose only. If you do want to run this ransomware, run it in an isolated environment. STAY SAFE AND DON&amp;rsquo;T GET IN TROUBLE!&#xA;Ever since I started watching Mr. Robot, I got really interested in hacking and hackers. I&amp;rsquo;m not a hacker myself but I do like learning about how people have found ways to exploit computers.</description>

      <title>The pressure of OceanGate&#39;s Titan</title>

      <description>I was bored so I went down the rabbit hole of engineering disasters. One disaster that caught my eyes was the OceanGate&amp;rsquo;s Titan incident. It caught my eyes because I was curious about how much pressure was applied onto the submarine at that depth, so I grab my calculator and got to work.&#xA;The most dangerous thing about deep ocean is probably the hydrostatic pressure. This pressure is proportional to the depth measured from the surface of the water body.</description>
