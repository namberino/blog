description: "Learn about operating systems by making one from scratch"
---

We are going to build an operating system from **scratch**. Why you may ask? Well, I had finished an operating system class a few semester ago but it was a whole lot of theory and no practice on those theory what so ever. After that class, I didn't feel like I truly understand operating system and how they work. So I decided to try to make my own operating system to get more practical experience and a deeper understanding of OS development.

I'll share my journey on this blog. I'll try to explain everything in details to the best of my abilities and understanding so that anyone who wants to take on a similar endeavor can learn faster.
